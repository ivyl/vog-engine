# VOG Engine

## What?

It happened to mess with Scala and core IO. It uses simple caching
facilities, and other stuff. Some beginning game coders may find here some
inspiration code/to use.

## State?

That thing is suitable to make simple 2D sprite based game with no lighting.
Nothing serious though. It was running on Scala 2.8 quite well, never was
tested with 2.9.


## Future?

None.

## Dependencies
